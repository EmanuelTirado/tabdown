t - a todolist parser
=====================

t is a personal todolist parser for todo entries in markdown-ish text files.


##Usage:
>t //Prints a formatted list of todo entries
>
>t --now //Prints the current task.

The path of the todolist is by default $HOME/s
By default, t only prints first 4 tasks

The Todo list would look something like this this:

>#Tomorrow

>	Finish History Paper

>		Hand it in at 10pm

>		DO IN LIBRARY!

>	Finish math hw	

>	#Today

>	Push to Github

>		Edit Readme!

>	Read book

>#This line is ignored b/c it doesn't start with tab

>	Buy rubbing alcohol

>	Make todo list

>	This is the 5th item on the list

And the output would look like
>t

>	Push to Github

>		Edit Readme!

>	Read book

>	Buy rubbing alcohol

>	Make todo list
